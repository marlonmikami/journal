# IDENTITY

My identity as **the helper** is meant to give my life direction.

I know of things I want to do and accomplish, but how to justify them and bring them all together? How to bring forth the energy to do and to be? When given the option of innert comfort, how will I find it in me to do the things that will give me the life that I want?

Through the years I have time and again felt that **helping people** is something that brings me joy and fills my heart in ways that nothing else does. I Have now decided to solidify that as the most defining part of my identity.

This identity will serve as the foundation to justify the things I want to accomplish and energize me to make them into reality. It will also guide my interactions with others, serving as my effort to be a positive presence their lifes.
