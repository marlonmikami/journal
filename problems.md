# PROBLEMS
Current problems in my life that have been bothering me for a while and need fixing.

## Problems
1. I eat doritos and candy too often. Going over to the market every day gives me a reason to walk, but also gives me an oportunity to eat a bunch of trash
2. I've lost control of my finances and have been burning a lot of money

## Solutions
1. Go to the market only once a week. Change my walking route to around the block or to that park nearby
2. Finances?
