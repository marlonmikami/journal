# CAREER AND FINANCIAL PLANS

## Magic spending
I'll limit my budget for magic cards to 250 bucks a month, up to december 2022.

Starting in January 2023 I'll reduce the budget for cards by 50 bucks each month, but going no lower than 50 a month.

Priorities: Finish the decks i'm building and get the remaining relevant lands.

## Apartment payment plan
Every 6 month I'll add an extra payment to the amount I pay in monthly amortization.

In July 2024 I'll be paying 6 monthly payments in amortization and will stop increasing the number of monthly payments.

Following this plan I'll be done paying for the apartment before the end of 2027 (5 year plan starting in 2022).
