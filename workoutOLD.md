# WORKOUT

Two day split repeated twice a week, with three days of rest.
## Day one (mon/thu)
* Chin-ups
* Push ups

## Day two (tue/fri)
* Abs rollers
* Squats

## Rest (wed/sat/sun)
* Walk 10k steps

Perform **drop sets** (Start the workout with the most dificult variation you can do an adequate number of reps, change to an easier variation upon failure)

(I'll be testing doing a single drop set of each exercise for now. If I see no results even after increasing my protein consumption I'll change to two sets)
