# NUTRITION

A **high protein** diet is necessary for muscle building, so have eggs or meat with every meal.

**Calorie allowance**: Don't spend your calorie allowence in things that bring little fulfillment, save it for a really nice meal that you'll deeply enjoy instead, preferably one in a social situation. 

## High Satiety foods:
* Boiled Potatos
* Oats, Apples, Eggs
* Fish, Red meat
* Cheese, Grapes

## Alcohol:
Alcohol is to be used only when socializing and it must be planned around. You shouldn't have alcohol at home unless you are inviting people over.
If you drink, there's a good chance that you'l also overeat as well, so fasting on that day you plan on drinking is probably a good idea.
The closer a beverage is to being pure alcohol, the less calories it has. Vodka based drinks are prefered.

## Recipes:
* To-do
